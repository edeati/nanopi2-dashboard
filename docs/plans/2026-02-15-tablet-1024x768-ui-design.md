# 1024x768 Tablet UI Redesign

## Goal
Improve readability and balance on an old 8-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A (1024x768) while preserving all existing dashboard data and behavior.

## Constraints
- Keep all existing widgets visible (radar, solar, weather, bins, clock).
- Preserve existing rendering and polling behavior.
- Do not alter radar GIF/PNG logic, takeover flows, or data APIs.
- Keep theme compatibility (`matte`, `glass`, `neon`).

## Chosen Direction
Balanced layout with tablet-specific visual overrides.

### Key Decisions
- Add a dedicated landscape tablet breakpoint.
- Keep bottom row as 3 cards with ratio `weather 1.7 / bins 1 / clock 1`.
- Increase top status bar vertical space and ticker readability.
- Keep structural HTML and JavaScript behavior intact; apply CSS-only adaptation.

## Layout Design
- Breakpoint target: `max-width: 1100`, `max-height: 820`, `min-height: 700`, landscape.
- Increase `--global-bar-clearance` so the main frame sits lower and avoids overlap.
- Increase pill height/padding and ticker size; slow ticker animation for scanning headlines.
- Adjust frame row split to give bottom row more vertical room on tablet.
- Keep radar and solar dominance in top row while improving lower card legibility.

## Typography and Density
- Slightly increase panel title/icon size.
- Increase weather summary/temp readability without clipping forecast rows.
- Increase bins icon/headline/date sizing for distance readability.
- Increase clock time/date sizing modestly.
- Raise key solar values slightly while preserving chart area.

## Risk and Validation
- Low risk: CSS-only, breakpoint-scoped, no data flow or logic changes.
- Validation:
  - UI structure test coverage for breakpoint and key tablet overrides.
  - Full test suite run to confirm no regressions.
